Based on the analysis of departmental wise nurse attrition data, 
it was found that the highest attrition rate was from the Maternity department. 
Further analysis revealed that the nurses who had a marital status of "single", rarely traveled, 
and were between the ages of 20 to 35 were more likely to leave the organization. 
Additionally, employees with medium job satisfaction, medium income, 
and who were in a junior level position with too far promotion opportunities were also more likely to leave the organization.
